# Salary-Tracker

## Why I Built It

I needed a solution to **track my salary** in a way that fit my specific needs, but I couldn‚Äôt find an existing
application that provided exactly what I wanted. This project was created to:

- Provide a **customized salary tracking system**.
- Apply and deepen my knowledge in **Jakarta EE, Open Liberty**.
